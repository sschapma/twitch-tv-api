# [Twitch.tv API](http://codepen.io/schap843/debug/XddGeJ)

### Twitch.tv JSON API for FreeCodeCamp. Includes an array of 30 power users of twitch.tv. By default, only shows users currently streaming. You can click the buttons to display all users, only those online, or only those offline.

### If a user is currently streaming, it displays some information about the stream and number of viewers. Clicking on the modal will bring you directly to their live stream.
